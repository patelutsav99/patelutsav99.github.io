  I am <Strong> Utsav Patel</strong> studying computer science
   expected to graduate this year. I came to USA about ten years ago and
    completed middle school and high school. <br>
   The goal which I had set for college was to graduate in three years, which I am about to do.
   Currently, my future goal is to create an IT company after, graduation. Besides,
   this couple of my hobbies are watching sports and news.
   I believe that by watching news one can increase their knowledge.
